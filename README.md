### Summary

Cosmos Cash is a protocol designed to be regulatory compliant that offers the same guarantees as traditional banking systems. Features that enable these guarantees are KYC (Know your customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering) tracking, FAFT travel rule, and identity management. We use a novel approach to identity management by leveraging W3C specifications for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.
