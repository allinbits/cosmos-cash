# Explanation Docmentsation

How to use the Cosmos Cash Explanation Documentation.

[TOC]


## Context

In Cosmos Cash we use the  *Grand Unified Theory of Documentation* (David Laing) as described by [Divio](https://documentation.divio.com/) as a basis for our documentation strategy.

This approach outlines four specific use cases for documentation:

* [Tutorials](../Tutorials/README.md)
* [How-Tos](../How-To/README.md)
* [Explanation](./README.md)
* [Reference](./Reference/README.md)


This section addresses the third of these: **Explanation documentation**. 

For further background please see [the ADR relating to the documentation structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md). 

## Approach

This content is intended to help readers with their **understanding of Cosmos Cash and related topics**. 

* If you are looking for information about an API call or a Module specification or Archiecture diagrams then please go to [Reference](../Reference) section
* If you are looking how to achieve a specific task then please go to [How-To](../How-To)

This documentation is intended to be discursive, thoughtful, interesting and occaisionally educational. It will include analysis and alternatives. 

Not all explanations can be in this folder so please see [Discussions](#Discussions) section for further sources.

## Layout
### Topics

Topics are discursive documents that explore some particular feature or theme.  For example, an article might investigate Decentralised Identity Documents or Self-Sovereign Identity.

To contribute, create a folder in [topics](./topics) with a self-descriptive name. Add your content as needed.

### Presentations

[Presentations](PRESENTATIONS.md) will have link to presentations about Cosmos Cash at various events. This will also include YouTube links, podcasts as needed.


### Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)

 ADRs are the mechanism for conributers to raise design proposals. In turn they explain for subsequent contributers the rationale behind Cosmos Cash design and implementation. An example would be why this [documentation structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md) was chosen. 

See the [ADR README](./ADR/README.md) Further details about how to raise and propose an ADR.

### Articles

This folder contains all articles relating to Cosmos Cash. This includes papers, blog posts etc. See [Articles README](articles/README.md) for further details.


## Discussions

Explanation is not only limited to articles, topics etc. It also includes discussion on relevant channels. This includes [Pull Requests](https://github.com/allinbits/cosmos-cash/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/allinbits/cosmos-cash/issues). Important Pull Requests will be listed in this document.

Cosmos Cash currently doesn't have a Discord or Telegram Channel. When we do the links will be added here as well
## Contributing
