# Explanation Documentation

How to use the Cosmos Cash Explanation Documentation.

[TOC]


## Context

In Cosmos Cash we use the  *Grand Unified Theory of Documentation* (David Laing) as described by [Divio](https://documentation.divio.com/) as a basis for our documentation strategy.

This approach outlines four specific use cases for documentation:

* [Tutorials](../Tutorials/README.md)
* [How-Tos](../How-To/README.md)
* [Explanation](./README.md)
* [Reference](./Reference/README.md)


This section addresses the third of these: **Explanation documentation**. 

For further background, see [the ADR relating to the documentation structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md). 

## Approach

This content is intended to help readers with their **understanding of Cosmos Cash and related topics**. 

* See the [Reference](../Reference) section for information about an API call, Module specification, or Architecture diagrams 
* See the [How-To](../How-To) section for steps to achieve a specific task

This documentation is intended to be discursive, thoughtful, interesting, and occasionally educational. The content includes analysis and alternatives. 

For more explanations, see the [Discussions](#Discussions) section.

## Layout
### Topics

Topics are discursive documents that explore some particular feature or theme.  For example, an article might investigate Decentralised Identity Documents or Self-Sovereign Identity.

To contribute, create a folder in [topics](./topics) with a self-descriptive name. Add your content as needed.

### Presentations

The [Presentations](PRESENTATIONS.md) file describes and links to presentations about Cosmos Cash at various events. Presentations also include YouTube videos,  podcasts, interviews, and so on. 


### Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)

 ADRs are the mechanism for contributors to raise design proposals. In turn, the ADRs explain for subsequent contributors the rationale behind Cosmos Cash design and implementation. For example, [ADR 002: Documentation Structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md) explains why the Cosmos Cash documentation structure was chosen. 

See the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) [README](./ADR/README.md) file for more details about how to raise and propose an ADR.

### Articles

This folder contains all articles relating to Cosmos Cash, includes papers, blog posts, and so on. For details, see [Articles README](articles/README.md).


## Discussions

The explanation content includes articles, topics, and so on, and also includes discussion on relevant channels, including [Pull Requests](https://github.com/allinbits/cosmos-cash/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/allinbits/cosmos-cash/issues). Important Pull Requests are listed in this document.

Future: Cosmos Cash currently doesn't have a Discord or Telegram Channel. When we do, the links will be added here as well
## Contributing
