## Introduction

This section contains **Explanation documentation** for Cosmos Cash. This content is intended to help readers with their **understanding of Cosmos Cash and related topics**. It is intended to be discursive, thoughtful, interesting, and occasionally educational. The content includes analysis and review of alternative approaches. 

For further background information please see [the ADR relating to the documentation structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md). 

## Layout
### Topics

Topics are discursive documents that explore some particular feature or theme.  For example, an article might investigate Decentralised Identity Documents or Self-Sovereign Identity.

To contribute, create a folder in [topics](./topics) with a self-descriptive name. Add your content as needed.

### Presentations

The [Presentations](PRESENTATIONS.md) file describes and links to presentations about Cosmos Cash at various events. Presentations also include YouTube videos,  podcasts, interviews, and so on. 


### Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)

 ADRs are the mechanism for contributors to raise design proposals. In turn, the ADRs explain for subsequent contributors the rationale behind Cosmos Cash design and implementation. For example, [ADR 002: Documentation Structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md) explains why the Cosmos Cash documentation structure was chosen. 

See the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) [README](./ADR/README.md) file for more details about how to raise and propose an ADR.

### Articles

This folder contains all articles relating to Cosmos Cash, includes papers, blog posts, and so on. For details, see [Articles README](articles/README.md).


## Discussions
