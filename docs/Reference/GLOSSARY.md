# GLOSSARY

## A

### asset-referenced tokens (ART)

Several fiat currencies, one or several commodities or one or several
crypto-assets, or a combination of such assets (the so called “reserve assets”) within the [MiCA](#market-in-crypto-assets-mica) context.

## B

## C

### crypto-asset service provider (CASP)

Any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more
crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis.

## D

### Decentralized Identifier (DID)

A type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically. DIDs are fully conformant [Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). [W3C defines a DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#a-simple-example) as a _portable URL-based identifier ... associated with an entity ... An example of a DID is `did:example:123456abcdef"*`_.  

### e-money tokens (EMT)

A type of crypto asset for one single fiat currency.

## H

### holder

In the SSI ecosystem, the holder receives identity credentials from an issuer.

## I

### identity management (IdM)

A framework of policies and technologies to ensure that users have the appropriate access to technology resources.

### identity provider (IdP)

The primary component of an identity management (IdM) system that creates, stores, and manages digital identities to provide services such as signup, authentication, and authorization.

### issuer

In the SSI ecosystem, the issuer generates and issues identity credentials.

### key management system (KMS)

A system for the management of cryptographic keys and their metadata.

## L

### legal person

Any person or entity that is able to perform legal activities, such as enter into contracts, own property, and so on.

## M

### Market in Crypto-assets (MiCA)

[Legislation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593)
that covers crypto assets in the European Union.

### mediator

In the SSI ecosystem, the mediator participates in agent-to-agent message delivery. 

### mediator agent 

SSI agents, built on the Aries Go Framework, serve as a bridge between agents. 

## R

### regulator

An entity that is established by governments or other organizations to oversee the functioning and fairness of financial markets
and the firms that engage in financial activity.

## S

### self-sovereign identity (SSI)

An approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital
identities, this emerging identity model allows any person, organization, or subject to have multiple sovereign, persistent, and portable identities.

## V

### verifiable credential (VC)

A tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. A standard data model and representation format for cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials is defined by the [W3C Verifiable Credentials specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-vc-data-model).

### verifiable data registry (VDR)

A system that facilitates the creation, verification, updating, and deactivation of decentralized identifiers and [DID](#decentralized-identifier-did)
documents. A verifiable data registry might also be used for other cryptographically-verifiable data structures such as
verifiable credentials (VCs).

### verifiable presentation (VP)

A tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be
trusted after a process of cryptographic verification.

### verifier

In the SSI ecosystem, the verifier receives and validates a holder's credentials.

### Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)

FATF defines a virtual asset service provider (VASP) as the following:
“Any natural/legal person who ... as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on
behalf of another natural or legal person:
i. exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies; ii. exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets; iii.
transfer of virtual assets; iv. safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over
virtual assets; and v. participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s offer and/or sale of
a virtual
asset.” [FATF guidance to the G20](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/virtualassets/documents/report-g20-so-called-stablecoins-june-2020.html)

## Z

### zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)

In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information ([Zero-knowledge proof on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)).
