# GLOSSARY

## A

### Asset-referenced tokens (ART)

Several fiat currencies, one or several commodities or one or several
crypto-assets, or a combination of such assets (the so called “reserve assets”) within the [MiCA](#market-in-crypto-assets-mica) context.

## B

## C

### Crypto-asset service provider (CASP)

Any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more
crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis.

## D

### Decentralized Identifier (DID)

W3C defines a Decentralized Identifier (DID) as a _portable URL-based identifier ... associated with an entity ... An
example of a DID is `did:example:123456abcdef"*`_

### E-money tokens (EMT)

A type of crypto asset for one single fiat currency

## L

### Legal Person

Any person or entity that is able to perform legal activities, such as enter into contracts, own property, and so on

## M

### Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)

[Legislation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593)
that covers crypto assets in the European Union

## R

### Regulator

An entity that is established by governments or other organizations to oversee the functioning and fairness of financial markets
and the firms that engage in financial activity.

## S

### Self-sovereign identity (SSI)

An approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital
identities

## V

### Verifiable credential (VC)

A standard data model and representation format for cryptographically-verifiable digital
credentials defined by the [W3C Verifiable Credentials specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#bib-vc-data-model)

### Verifiable data registry (VDR)

A system that facilitates the creation, verification, updating, and/or deactivation of decentralized identifiers and [DID](#decentralized-identifier-did)
documents. A verifiable data registry might also be used for other cryptographically-verifiable data structures such as
verifiable credentials.

### Verifiable presentation (VP)

A tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be
trusted after a process of cryptographic verification

### Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)

FATF defines a virtual asset service provider (VASP) as the following:
“Any natural/legal person who ... as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on
behalf of another natural or legal person:
i. exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies; ii. exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets; iii.
transfer of virtual assets; iv. safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over
virtual assets; and v. participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s offer and/or sale of
a virtual
asset.” [FATF guidance to the G20](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/virtualassets/documents/report-g20-so-called-stablecoins-june-2020.html)

## Z

### Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP)

In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information ([Zero-knowledge proof on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)).
