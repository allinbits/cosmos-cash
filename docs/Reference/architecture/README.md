# Architecture

## Overview

Architecture documentation is based on [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). This contains lots of documentation and examples. Diagrams are created through text based documents (`.puml` files) which are then rendered into an appropriate format, in a similar manner to pandoc for markdown and pdfs/html.

PlantUML was chosen as the architecture medium for a number of reasons, of which the most important are:

1. It supports a number of different types of diagram: class, sequence, activity, ERM ...
2. Diagrams can be stored with the codebase and documentation rather in a separate system such as Whimsical and then imported as needed into documentation.
