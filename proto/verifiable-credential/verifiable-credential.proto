/*
Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert
that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used
to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to
travel between countries. This proto file provides a mechanism to express
these sorts of credentials on a blockchain in a way that is cryptographically
secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

This data structure represents a verifiable credential
