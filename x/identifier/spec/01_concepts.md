This module represents the did core spec. For more information please see the [[core-spec].](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.

A DID is a globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically.
